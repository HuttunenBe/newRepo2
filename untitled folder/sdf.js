const orders = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("ordersNew")) || [];

//If there are no saved orders in the browser's memory, it uses an empty list [] as a fallback.
//JSON.parse() is a function that turns the saved data (which is a string) back into a usable JavaScript object (like a list or an order).
//localStorage.getItem("ordersNew") is a way to get the orders from the browser's memory.




//The addNewOrder function takes several pieces of information (parameters) as input:
//Now, inside the function, there's the following code:
//This creates a new order object. An object is like a "package" that holds related information together.


orders.push(newOrder);
//orders.push(newOrder) is adding the new order to the list of existing orders (orders). So, it's like putting the new order into a box (the orders list).
