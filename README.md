Steps for this task:

- create folder
- create new Github repository
- add readme file
- connect 

- make changes in local 
-> push (git status, git add ., git commit -m"", git push origin master)
- make changes in remota
-> pull (git pull origin master)
- Push once again

- Solve merge!! (if needed can be fixed from files >>>>)
- update readme 


How to avoid merge conflict? (git status,)

- Use only local so that when you push there won't be changes in repository
- always pull first just to be sure. there might be changes.  


- remember to not use init everytime
